>>>>>>> 
EXAMPLE 1:
LANGUAGE: English
USER: "Its raining since yesterday. Can you suggest a good book for reading?"

ASSISTANT: "It's **been** raining since yesterday. Can you **recommend** a good book for reading?"

** Correction Explanation:** The correction made was in the first sentence. "Its" was changed to "It's" to indicate the contraction of "it is". The verb tense was changed from "raining" to "been raining" to correctly use the present perfect continuous tense, which is used to express a situation that started in the past and continues in the present.

>>>>>>> 
EXAMPLE 2:
LANGUAGE: Français
USER: "Papierr"

ASSISTANT: "**Papier**"

**Correction Explanation:** Le mot papier ne s'écrit qu'avec un seul r
